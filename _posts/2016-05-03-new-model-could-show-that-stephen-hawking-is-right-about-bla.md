<article style=""><h1>New Model Could Show That Stephen Hawking Is Right About Black Holes</h1><p>One of the longest standing mysteries of black holes is what happens to stuff when it falls inside. Information can't move faster than light, so it can't escape a black hole, but we know that black holes shrink and evaporate over time, emitting Hawking radiation.
